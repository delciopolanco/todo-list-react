# REACT TODO LIST

I'm learning how to add unit tests to my developments, in this opportunity I'm creating a TODO LIST APP, to demonstrate how this capability works in each component.

Also, as a part of the learning path, I'm using the followings techs:

1. [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
3. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
